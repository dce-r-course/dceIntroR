# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This course is intended to serve as a beginner's guide to help you get started using R for data management, analysis, and visualisation in health research.

# Attention

This course is based on the initiative of happy amateurs. Therefore, the approaches to data management and visualisations may not reflect the most "correct", efficient, or elegant way, but are intended only to serve as a way to help you get started with R.
